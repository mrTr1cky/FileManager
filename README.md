Installation

Prerequisites:

PHP 7.4 or higher.
Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with PHP support.
Write permissions for the directory where the script is installed.
shell_exec enabled in php.ini for command shell functionality.


Setup:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advance-file-manager.git
cd advance-file-manager


Configuration:

Open index.php and update the $password variable:$password = "your_secure_password"; // Change this!


Ensure the directory is writable by the web server (e.g., chmod 755 or 777 for testing, then secure it).


Deploy:

Upload index.php to your web server.
Access the script via your browser (e.g., http://yourdomain.com/index.php).


Security:

Change the default password immediately.
Restrict access to the script (e.g., via .htaccess or server configuration).
Check php_errors.log for any issues after deployment.



Usage

Login:

Enter the configured password to access the file manager.
Accept the cookie consent prompt for session handling.


File Operations:

Use the upload form to add files.
Create files or folders via the create form.
Click file names to navigate directories or perform actions (edit, download, rename, delete).


Command Shell:

Toggle the command shell panel using the "Toggle Command Shell" button.
Select preset commands or enter custom ones.
Click command history entries to reuse commands.
Clear history with the "Clear History" button.


Navigation:

Click segments in the directory path (e.g., /homepages/22/d448530657/htdocs) to jump to parent directories.


Logout:

Click the "Logout" link to end the session.



Security Notes

Password: Always set a strong, unique password in $password.
Permissions: Ensure the script file (index.php) has restrictive permissions (e.g., 0600).
Shell Exec: The command shell uses shell_exec, which can be dangerous if not restricted. Disable it in php.ini (disable_functions) if not needed.
Error Logging: Check php_errors.log for issues. Ensure the log file is not publicly accessible.
HTTPS: Use HTTPS to secure session cookies and data transmission.
Access Control: Restrict access to trusted IPs or use additional authentication layers.

Debugging
If you encounter an HTTP 500 error:

Check php_errors.log in the script‚Äôs directory or the server‚Äôs default log location.
Verify:
Directory permissions (writable by the web server).
shell_exec availability (function_exists('shell_exec')).
Session storage path (session.save_path in php.ini).


Use the "Debug Information" section (visible after login) to check:
PHP version.
Session ID.
Current directory.
Shell exec status.
